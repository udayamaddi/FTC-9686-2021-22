#+TITLE: Example Repository
#+DESCRIPTION: This repository is a basic, commented sample of code with the basic structure and workings of non-Command-based robot code.

* Naming Conventions
** Motors
  - Drivetrain Motors
    - Mecanum Drivetrain
      - Must be named like such based on corresponding motor.
        - frontLeft
        - frontRight
        - backLeft
        - backRight
    - Other Drivetrains
      - Will be dealt with case-by-case.
  - Other Motors
    - Must begin with the lowercase m.
** Servos
- Must begin with lowercase s.
** Gamepads
- One Gamepad: gPad
- Two Gamepads: gPad1, gPad2
*** Button Readers
- _Note: If there is only one gamepad, remove the 1._
- buttonReaderY1, buttonReaderX1, buttonReaderA1, buttonReaderB1
- buttonReaderY2, buttonReaderX2, buttonReaderA2, buttonReaderB2
- rightBumper1, leftBumper1
- rightBumper2, leftBumper2
** Voltage
- Voltage Reader: voltageReader
- Any other variable based upon the value from voltageReader must begin with a lowercase v.
** ElapsedTime
- Must begin with lowercase t and then a number which ascends starting with 0.
** Camera-Related
- All camera-related variables must start with lowercase c or camera.
** Roadrunner
- Pose: Must start with lowercase p
- Trajectories: Must start with traj and always end with the number trajectory it is, starting from one.
  - Starts at one because startPose is traj0 technically.
